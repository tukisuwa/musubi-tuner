## MiniMax-H3 MFI (experimental)

This branch adds indexed multi-frame inference (MFI) and LoRA training for MiniMax-H3. MFI generates multiple images jointly, allowing them to share information during generation. Each image is assigned a coordinate; its intended role is defined by your training data and settings, not by a built-in label.

See the [English MFI guide](./docs/minimax_h3_mfi.md) / [日本語ガイド](./docs/minimax_h3_mfi_ja.md) for generation, dataset preparation, training, and limitations.

- August 14, 2026
    - Added experimental MiniMax-H3 teacher-matching training (`--h3_teacher_matching`): a T2VA LoRA is trained against the frozen base model's predictions under privileged conditioning — the clip's first/last frames, or the training clip itself as a copy-source reference (`--h3_teacher_conditions ref`) — structurally avoiding the de-distillation drift of plain flow targets. Includes a base-sigma preservation anchor, a decomposed anti-washout loss, timestep focus (`--h3_timestep_focus_*`, usable in any H3 training), and the `--lora_runtime_attach` / `--trajectory_dir` generation options. [PR #1047](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/1047). See the [MiniMax-H3 documentation](./docs/minimax_h3.md) for details.

- August 8, 2026
    - Added MiniMax-H3 ConvRot INT8 support for LoRA training and generation: BF16 checkpoints quantize at load time with `--convrot_int8`, and the released full and pruned ConvRot INT8 transformers and the ConvRot INT8 Qwen3-VL-32B text encoder are detected automatically. Generation attaches LoRAs to pre-quantized bases as runtime branches. Thank you sdbds [PR #1024](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/1024). See the [MiniMax-H3 documentation](./docs/minimax_h3.md) for details.

- August 3, 2026
    - Added experimental MiniMax-H3 R1 support for T2VA, FL2VA, and Ref2VA LoRA training plus standalone and scheduled training-time joint video/audio generation. R1 supports the published BF16 transformers, dual VAEs, Qwen3-VL-32B conditioning, and block swap. See the [MiniMax-H3 documentation](./docs/minimax_h3.md) for dataset, cache, training, generation, and R2 deferral details. [PR #1018](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/1018) Thank you sdbds for the contribution.

- July 14, 2026
    - Added the `--log_grad_metrics` option to log gradient norm diagnostics (`grad/norm`, `grad/mean_norm`, `grad/max`, measured before gradient clipping) to the tracker. Thank you rockerBOO [PR #988](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/988).
        - Useful for diagnosing gradient explosion / vanishing and for choosing an appropriate `--max_grad_norm` value. Disabled by default. See the [advanced configuration documentation](./docs/advanced_config.md#log-gradient-metrics--勾配メトリクスのログ出力) for details.

- June 24, 2026
    - Added experimental support for Krea 2 (LoRA training and inference). See [PR #980](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/980) for details.
        - For details, please refer to the [documentation](./docs/krea2.md).

- June 19, 2026
    - Added experimental support for Ideogram4 (LoRA training and inference). Many thanks to sdbds for [PR #966](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/966). Follow-ups were made in [PR #975](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/975) and [PR #977](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/977). Please refer to the PRs for detailed changes.
        - For details, please refer to the [documentation](./docs/ideogram4.md).
        - JSON format prompts are recommended, but natural language training is also possible.
        - Training settings details are unknown, so community information sharing is welcome.

- June 16, 2026
    - Added H2D-only block swap, an optimized block swap mode for LoRA (LoHa/LoKr) training, available for all architectures. Enable it with `--block_swap_h2d_only`. See [PR #972](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/972).
        - For frozen-base training, the base weights on the CPU and GPU are identical, so the classic block swap's device-to-host (D2H) copy is pure overhead. H2D-only keeps a permanent master copy on the CPU and only ever transfers host-to-device, removing the D2H transfer entirely. This can improve training throughput, with the largest benefit when using `--fp8_base` / `--fp8_scaled`.
        - Requires `--gradient_checkpointing`. The number of GPU ring buffers used for streaming can be tuned with `--block_swap_ring_size` (default `2`; `1` minimizes VRAM).
        - There is also a new standalone [Block Swap documentation](./docs/block_swap.md) covering all block swap options.

- June 13, 2026
    - Added the `--save_precision` option for network weights and changed the default save precision to fp32. Thank you rockerBOO [PR #967](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/967).
        - **Breaking Change**: The default save precision for LoRA files has been changed to fp32.
        - This preserves the precision of LoRA weights during training and is useful for post-processing such as post-hoc EMA, merging, extraction, and weight analysis.
        - LoRA files may be about twice as large as before when training with `--mixed_precision bf16`(`fp16`). To keep the previous behavior, specify `--save_precision bf16` (`fp16`).
        - Please refer to the [HunyuanVideo documentation](./docs/hunyuan_video.md#training--学習) for details.

- June 8, 2026
    - Added experimental support for HiDream-O1-Image (LoRA training, full finetuning, and inference). See [PR #964](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/964).
        - Please refer to the [documentation](./docs/hidream_o1.md) for details.
        - An optional DINOv3 auxiliary perceptual loss is also available. See the [advanced configuration documentation](./docs/advanced_config.md).
        - Many thanks to sdbds for [PR #947](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/947) (followed by [PR #955](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/955)), which this support is based on. Please open the PRs if you would like to review the changes in detail.

- May 22, 2026
    - Performed a large-scale internal refactoring to improve code quality and maintainability. See [PR #950](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/950)
        - We have taken care to ensure that there are no direct impacts on users. For details and to report any issues, please refer to [this discussion](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/discussions/949).

### Releases

We are grateful to everyone who has been contributing to the Musubi Tuner ecosystem through documentation and third-party tools. To support these valuable contributions, we recommend working with our [releases](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/releases) as stable reference points, as this project is under active development and breaking changes may occur.

You can find the latest release and version history in our [releases page](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/releases).

### For Developers Using AI Coding Agents

This repository provides recommended instructions to help AI agents like Claude and Gemini understand our project context and coding standards.

To use them, you need to opt-in by creating your own configuration file in the project root.

**Quick Setup:**

1.  Create a `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and/or `AGENTS.md` file in the project root.
2.  Add the following line to your `CLAUDE.md` to import the repository's recommended prompt (currently they are the almost same):

    ```markdown
    @./.ai/claude.prompt.md
    ```

    or for Gemini:

    ```markdown
    @./.ai/gemini.prompt.md
    ```

    You may be also import the prompt depending on the agent you are using with the custom prompt file such as `AGENTS.md`.

3.  You can now add your own personal instructions below the import line (e.g., `Always include a short summary of the change before diving into details.`).

This approach ensures that you have full control over the instructions given to your agent while benefiting from the shared project context. Your `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md` and `AGENTS.md` (as well as Claude's `.mcp.json`) are already listed in `.gitignore`, so they won't be committed to the repository.

## Installation

### pip based installation

Python 3.10 or later is required (verified with 3.10).

Create a virtual environment and install PyTorch and torchvision matching your CUDA version. 

PyTorch 2.5.1 or later is required (see [note](#PyTorch-version)).

```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

Install the required dependencies using the following command.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Optionally, you can use FlashAttention and SageAttention (**for inference only**; see [SageAttention Installation](#sageattention-installation) for installation instructions).

Optional dependencies for additional features:
- `ascii-magic`: Used for dataset verification
- `matplotlib`: Used for timestep visualization
- `tensorboard`: Used for logging training progress
- `prompt-toolkit`: Used for interactive prompt editing in Wan2.1 and FramePack inference scripts. If installed, it will be automatically used in interactive mode. Especially useful in Linux environments for easier prompt editing.

```bash
pip install ascii-magic matplotlib tensorboard prompt-toolkit
```

### uv based installation (experimental)

You can also install using uv, but installation with uv is experimental. Feedback is welcome.

1. Install uv (if not already present on your OS).

#### Linux/MacOS

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Follow the instructions to add the uv path manually until you restart your session...

#### Windows

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Follow the instructions to add the uv path manually until you reboot your system... or just reboot your system at this point.

## Model Download

Model download procedures vary by architecture. Please refer to the architecture-specific documents in the [Documentation](#documentation) section for instructions.

## Usage


### Dataset Configuration

Please refer to [here](./docs/dataset_config.md).

### Pre-caching

Pre-caching procedures vary by architecture. Please refer to the architecture-specific documents in the [Documentation](#documentation) section for instructions.

### Configuration of Accelerate

Run `accelerate config` to configure Accelerate. Choose appropriate values for each question based on your environment (either input values directly or use arrow keys and enter to select; uppercase is default, so if the default value is fine, just press enter without inputting anything). For training with a single GPU, answer the questions as follows:

```txt
- In which compute environment are you running?: This machine
- Which type of machine are you using?: No distributed training
- Do you want to run your training on CPU only (even if a GPU / Apple Silicon / Ascend NPU device is available)?[yes/NO]: NO
- Do you wish to optimize your script with torch dynamo?[yes/NO]: NO
- Do you want to use DeepSpeed? [yes/NO]: NO
- What GPU(s) (by id) should be used for training on this machine as a comma-seperated list? [all]: all
- Would you like to enable numa efficiency? (Currently only supported on NVIDIA hardware). [yes/NO]: NO
- Do you wish to use mixed precision?: bf16
```

*Note*: In some cases, you may encounter the error `ValueError: fp16 mixed precision requires a GPU`. If this happens, answer "0" to the sixth question (`What GPU(s) (by id) should be used for training on this machine as a comma-separated list? [all]:`). This means that only the first GPU (id `0`) will be used.

### Training and Inference

Training and inference procedures vary significantly by architecture. Please refer to the architecture-specific documents in the [Documentation](#documentation) section and the various configuration documents for detailed instructions.

## Miscellaneous

### SageAttention Installation

sdbsd has provided a Windows-compatible SageAttention implementation and pre-built wheels here:  https://github.com/sdbds/SageAttention-for-windows. After installing triton, if your Python, PyTorch, and CUDA versions match, you can download and install the pre-built wheel from the [Releases](https://github.com/sdbds/SageAttention-for-windows/releases) page. Thanks to sdbsd for this contribution.

For reference, the build and installation instructions are as follows. You may need to update Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable to the latest version.

1. Download and install triton 3.1.0 wheel matching your Python version from [here](https://github.com/woct0rdho/triton-windows/releases/tag/v3.1.0-windows.post5).

2. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 or Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022, configured for C++ builds.

3. Clone the SageAttention repository in your preferred directory:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.git
    ```

4. Open `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022` from the Start menu under Visual Studio 2022.

5. Activate your venv, navigate to the SageAttention folder, and run the following command. If you get a DISTUTILS not configured error, set `set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1` and try again:
    ```shell
    python setup.py install
    ```

This completes the SageAttention installation.

### PyTorch version

If you specify `torch` for `--attn_mode`, use PyTorch 2.5.1 or later (earlier versions may result in black videos).

If you use an earlier version, use xformers or SageAttention.
